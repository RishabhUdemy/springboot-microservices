We need not to configure application.properties/yml using @propertySource becoz it part spring boot application echo system (SpringApplication(-) internally locates and recgonizes as part of application startup activities)
Any other user-defined properties placed any location must be cfg explicitly using @propertySource annotation..

Can we change name or location of application.properties/application.yml?
Ans  Yes we can change but it must be configured explicitly using @PropertySources

application.properties/yml file contain
=======================================
	DataSource cfg
	Spring boot banner cfg
	spring boot log message
	spring boot web application cfg spring.port
	spring security
	spring batch cfgs
	spring actuator cfg
	spring mail cfg
	InMemory DB cfg
	Messaging cfg
	Zuul proxy cfg
	Gateway cfg and etc

url for spring boot properties key https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/application-properties.html 

These pre-defined keys based message we can place both in application.properties/yml and also in user-defined additional properties/yml file

if we change the name or location or extension of application.properties/yml file then it must be cfg explicitly using @PropertySource annotation

we can inject values spring bean properties/yml files we can use two type annotation
1. @Value
2. @ConfigurationProperties

@Value 
	To inject each value to each spring bean property seperately
 	To inject 20 values of properties/yml file to 20 spring bean properties we need to use @Value annotation for 20 times

@ConfigurationProperties (given by spring boot and cannot be used in spring application)
	Support bulk injection (ie we need to write @ConfigurationProperties only 1 time on the top of spring bean class)
	All keys in properties file must have same prefix and spring property names must be there in keys as last words (matching with each other)
	Taking common prefix work for keys of properties/yml file in mandatory
